3. Build OpenROAD
   
   ```shell
   ./build_openroad.sh --local --threads 1
   ```
   
   ~~NOTE: The local build failed so i resorted to using prebuilt binaries from [Using Pre-built Binaries &#8212; OpenROAD Flow documentation](https://openroad-flow-scripts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/BuildWithPrebuilt.html)~~
