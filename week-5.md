3. Build OpenROAD
   
   ```shell
   ./build_openroad.sh --local
   ```
   
   NOTE: The local build failed so i resorted to using prebuilt binaries from [Using Pre-built Binaries &#8212; OpenROAD Flow documentation](https://openroad-flow-scripts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/BuildWithPrebuilt.html)

   source ./env.sh
   yosys -help  
   openroad -help
   ```
